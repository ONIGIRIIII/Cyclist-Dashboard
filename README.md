# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: Converting Casual Riders to Annual Members

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis case study for Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. As a junior data analyst on the marketing team, I analyzed user behavior patterns to develop strategic recommendations for converting casual riders into annual members, ultimately driving revenue growth.

**Analysis Period:** January 2025 - August 2025  
**Primary Goal:** Increase annual membership conversions to maximize revenue

### Key Questions

- What are the usage patterns between casual riders and annual members?
- When and where do casual riders use the service most frequently?
- What behavioral differences can inform targeted marketing strategies?
- How can we optimize conversion strategies for the next 4 months (September-December 2025)?

### Stakeholders

- **Lily Moreno:** Director of Marketing
- **Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** Data-driven strategy team
- **Cyclistic Executive Team:** Final decision makers

### Success Metrics

- Increase annual membership conversion rate
- Maximize revenue from existing casual rider base
- Develop data-backed marketing strategies for Q4 2025

## 2. Prepare

### Data Sources

**Dataset:** Cyclistic historical trip data (January 2025 - August 2025)  
**Source:** Motivate International Inc. (publicly available under license)  
**Organization:** Monthly CSV files containing ride details

### Data Structure

Key variables analyzed:
- `ride_id`: Unique identifier for each trip
- `rideable_type`: Type of bike used
- `started_at`: Trip start timestamp
- `ended_at`: Trip end timestamp
- `start_station_name`: Starting station location
- `end_station_name`: Ending station location
- `member_casual`: User type (member vs casual)

### Data Credibility (ROCCC)

- **Reliable:** First-party data directly from Cyclistic systems
- **Original:** Source data from actual bike-share transactions
- **Comprehensive:** 8 months of complete trip records
- **Current:** Recent data from 2025
- **Cited:** Properly licensed public dataset

### Limitations

- Privacy restrictions prevent linking individual users across multiple trips
- Unable to determine geographic residence of users
- Cannot connect pass purchases to payment methods

---

## 3. Process

### Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets:** Initial data cleaning and exploration
- **SQL:** Data aggregation and transformation
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard creation and visualization
- **GitHub:** Version control and documentation

### Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Removed duplicates** based on ride_id
2. **Handled missing values** in station names and coordinates
3. **Created calculated fields:**
   - `ride_length`: Duration of each trip (ended_at - started_at)
   - `day_of_week`: Day name for each ride (1=Sunday, 7=Saturday)
   - `hour_of_day`: Hour when ride started (0-23)
4. **Filtered invalid data:**
   - Removed trips with negative duration
   - Excluded trips longer than 24 hours (likely data errors)
   - Removed maintenance and testing rides
5. **Standardized formats:**
   - Consistent date/time formatting
   - Unified station name conventions
   - Standardized member type categories

### Data Integrity Checks

- Verified all ride_ids are unique
- Confirmed date ranges fall within analysis period
- Validated that member_casual field only contains "member" or "casual"
- Cross-checked station names against official station list

---

## 4. Analyze

### Analysis Methodology

Conducted comprehensive analysis across three key dimensions:

1. **Geographic Analysis:** Location-based usage patterns
2. **Temporal Analysis:** Time-based behavior patterns
3. **Duration Analysis:** Trip length comparisons

### Key Calculations

- **Average ride length** by user type
- **Total rides per day/hour/location** by user type
- **Peak usage times** and seasonal trends
- **Station popularity rankings** by user type
- **Weekly usage patterns** by day of week

### Analytical Insights

#### Finding 1: Location-Based Opportunity
The top 10 stations show significantly higher casual ridership compared to annual members, particularly at:
- Streeter Dr & Grand Ave
- DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St
- Kingsbury St & Kinzie St

**Insight:** These high-traffic casual locations represent prime conversion opportunities.

#### Finding 2: Peak Hour Patterns
Two distinct usage spikes occur at:
- **8:00 AM** - Morning commute
- **5:00 PM (17:00)** - Evening commute

**Insight:** Members dominate commute hours, while casual riders are more evenly distributed throughout the day.

#### Finding 3: Weekend vs Weekday Behavior
- **Weekdays:** Higher member volume, shorter average trip duration (~16-18 minutes)
- **Weekends:** Increased casual usage, longer average trip duration (~23-25 minutes)

**Insight:** Casual riders use bikes primarily for leisure on weekends, while members use them for daily commuting.

## 5. Share

### Visualizations

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

1. **Top 10 User Locations** (Bar Chart)
   - Compares casual vs member usage by station
   - Identifies conversion opportunity zones

2. **Number of Rides per Hour** (Area Chart)
   - Shows daily usage patterns
   - Highlights peak commute times

3. **Weekly Ride Patterns** (Combination Chart)
   - Displays ride volume by day of week
   - Overlays average duration trends
   - Reveals behavioral differences between user types

### Key Data Stories

**Story 1: The Leisure-to-Commute Opportunity**  
Casual riders primarily use bikes for longer leisure trips on weekends, while members use them for shorter, frequent commute trips. This suggests casual riders haven't yet discovered the commuting value proposition.

**Story 2: Geographic Concentration**  
Tourist and recreational areas show disproportionately high casual usage, indicating these locations are ideal for targeted conversion campaigns.

**Story 3: The Untapped Weekday Potential**  
Significant casual usage exists during weekdays, but with longer durations than member trips. This suggests an opportunity to educate casual riders about membership benefits for regular use.

## 6. Act

### Top 3 Strategic Recommendations

#### Recommendation 1: Location-Based Conversion Campaign (Q4 2025)

**Target Locations:** Top 10 casual-heavy stations (Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, etc.)

**Tactics:**

- Partner with nearby businesses to offer "member-exclusive" discounts

**Expected Impact:** 15-20% increase in conversions at targeted locations

**Budget:** $50,000 for Q4 2025

---

#### Recommendation 2: Peak-Hour Incentive Program

**Target Times:** 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM weekdays

**Tactics:**
- **"Commuter Challenge"**: Casual riders who take 3+ rides during peak hours in a month receive 30% off annual membership
- Push notifications to casual users during peak hours highlighting time and money saved with membership
- Implement "Fast Pass" lanes for members at busy stations during rush hour
